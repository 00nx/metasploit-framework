## Vulnerable Application

This Metasploit module exploits a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Splunk Enterprise.
The vulnerability affects versions 9.0.x prior to 9.0.7 and 9.1.x before 9.1.2.
The exploit takes advantage of a flaw in the XSLT transformation functionality of Splunk Enterprise
and requires valid credentials to be executed successfully, with the default credentials often being admin:changeme.

## Verification Steps
1. **Start Metasploit**: Launch `msfconsole` in your Metasploit framework.
2. **Select the Module**: Use the module with the command `use exploit/unix/http/splunk_xslt_authenticated_rce`.
3. **Disable AutoCheck**: Optionally, you can disable the automatic vulnerability check with `set AutoCheck false`.
4. **Set RHOSTS**: Define the target host (e.g., `set rhosts [target_ip_or_hostname]`).
5. **Set Credentials**: Provide valid Splunk credentials (username and password).
6. **Execute the Exploit**: Use the `exploit` command to run the exploit.

## Options
- **USERNAME**: The username for authentication.
- **PASSWORD**: The password for authentication.

### Exploitation Process
1. **Authentication**: The module authenticates using provided credentials.
2. **CSRF Token Extraction**: Extracts a CSRF token from the Splunk server for subsequent requests.
3. **Malicious File Upload**: Uploads a malicious XSL file to the server.
4. **Triggering XSLT Transformation**: Initiates an XSLT transformation to execute the payload.
5. **Executing Payload**: Executes the payload, resulting in a reverse shell or similar access.

### Expected Results
Upon successful exploitation, the attacker gains remote code execution capabilities on the target Splunk server,
usually as the user running the Splunk service.

### Important Notes
- This exploit requires valid credentials for successful execution.
