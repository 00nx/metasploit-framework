## Vulnerable Application
This combination of an Arbitrary File Read (CVE-2024-34102) and a Buffer Overflow in glibc (CVE-2024-2961)
allows for unauthenticated Remote Code Execution on the following versions of Magento and Adobe Commerce and
earlier if the PHP and glibc versions are also vulnerable:
  - 2.4.7 and earlier
  - 2.4.6-p5 and earlier
  - 2.4.5-p7 and earlier
  - 2.4.4-p8 and earlier

Vulenerable PHP versions:
  - From PHP 7.0.0 (2015) to 8.3.7 (2024)

Vulnerable iconv() function in the GNU C Library:
  - 2.39 and earlier

The exploit chain is quite interesting and for more detailed information I suggest reading the links in the
references. I'll give a very brief over view. CVE-2024-34102 is and XML External Entity vulnerability which
leverages PHP filters to read arbitrary files off the target system. The exploit chain uses this to read
/proc/self/maps off the system which provides the address of PHP's heap and the filename of the libc. Then
using the file read again the libc binary is downloaded and the exploit extracts the address and offset of the
following functions which are used to write the payload: libc_malloc, libc_system and libc_realloc.

With this information and expert knowledge of PHP, it's: chunks, free lists, buckets, bucket brigades and how
all such things are are stored in memory and affected by PHP filters, CVE-2024-2961 can then be exploited. A
long chain of PHP filters is constructed and sent in the same way the XXE is exploited which allows for; a
payload to be written to memory and for the buffer overflow to be exploited in order to redirect execution to
obtain RCE.

### Setup

The following docker-compose file can be used to test this module. There are a few things that need to be noted:
1. cURL is not installed by default in the target container, in order for a fetch payload to be successful run the
   following once the container has been started:
```
   docker exec -it magento_magento_1 bash 
   root@13c538f53068:/# apt update; apt install curl -y
```
2. The docker-compose file sets magento server's name to `localhost` and in order to exploit the container `rhost` must
   be set to `localhost` (setting `rhost` to `127.0.0.1` or your local IP address will not work for this docker-compose file)
   and so given this configuration `msfconsole` must be running on the same host as the container.
3. The network settings on my macbook didn't allow me to exploit this locally so I was running the containers and
   `msfconsole` from an Ubuntu 22.04 VM.

## Options

### DOWNLOAD_FILE_TIMEOUT
This specifies how long the module should wait to receive a file that was requested by the `download_file` method which
exploits the Arbitrary File Read vulnerability CVE-2024-34102.

## Verification Steps

1. Start msfconsole
1. Do: `use linux/http/magento_xxe_to_glibc_buf_overflow`
1. Set the `RHOST`, `SRVHOST` and `LHOST` options
1. Run the module
1. Receive 3 Meterpreter sessions as the `daemon` user.
